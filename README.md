# Warriors
Stanford CS106A Code In Place Final Project

This program is a simple multi-option text format game with self-closing popup images which use matplotlib as canvas.
The game is based upon the Warriors book series written by Erin Hunter. All in-game text was written and images drawn by my 
8yo daughter who also inspired this game. In game options are pulled from text files that can be expanded to increase the game 
depth. Future versions would add an aspect of decision for which medicines to be used for each type of warrior injury 
encountered. As it stands, warriors are healed if the appropriate medicine is present in the inventory. An additional 
possibility would be to add some form of learning, math, spelling, to complete healing procedures.
